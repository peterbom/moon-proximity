      <label>TLDR;</label>
    </div>
    <p data-mode="long">
      It sounds like a straightforward question, but happens to be deceptively complicated to answer. Why?
    </p>
    <ul data-mode="long">
      <li>The distance of the Moon at its perigee (the closest point to Earth in its orbit) varies over time.</li>
      <li>The Earth spins, so you need to work out which <em>part</em> of the Earth is closest to the Moon.</li>
      <li>
        The Earth is not perfectly spherical; it's an ellipsoid whose radius is greater at the equator than the poles.
      </li>
      <li>The Earth is not perfectly smooth; it has hills and mountains.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-mode="long">
      For any given place on Earth, you can use the excellent
      <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html">Horizons</a> tool from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to
      find the exact distance of the Moon at any time, latitude, longitude and altitude. But how do you know what time
      and position to search for?
    </p>
    <p data-mode="long">
      Here we're asking the reverse question. Assuming we can predict roughly when the Moon will be closest to the
      Earth, what position do we need to be at? And at exactly what time?
    </p>

    <h2>The Lunar Cycle</h2>
    <p data-mode="tldr">Select a time range.</p>
    <p data-mode="long">
      To get started, we need to know the times when the Moon is closest to the Earth. We'll temporarily shelve any
      questions about where on the surface of the Earth we'll need to be. Select a time range to browse.
    </p>
    <div id="time-range-view"></div>
    <div data-mode="long" id="new-moon-view"></div>
    <p data-mode="long">
      Here's a chart of the Moon's distance from Earth over the selected time period (you can zoom in to see shorter
      time periods):
    </p>
    <div data-mode="long" id="distance-time-view"></div>
    <p data-mode="long">
      Apparently it fluctuates quite wildly, but some patterns are evident. The large swings every month reflect the
      elliptical orbit of the Moon around the Earth. But you can also see that the size of the peaks and troughs varies
      somewhat regularly over time. What's going on with that?
    </p>
    <p data-mode="long">
      For our purposes here, we care mainly about the troughs (upside-down peaks, not animal feeders). These represent
      the points where the Moon is closest to the Earth (i.e. each <em>perigee</em> of the lunar orbit). Let's ignore
      the rest of the orbit and focus only on the perigees. Here they are:
    </p>
    <div data-mode="long" id="perigee-time-view"></div>
    <p data-mode="long">There are a few things to note here:</p>
    <ul data-mode="long">
      <li>Each circle shows the distance of the Moon at its perigee.</li>
      <li>The vertical white lines represent full moons.</li>
      <li>
        The dashed line does <em>not</em> represent the distance of the Moon, but is instead a best-fit of its distance
        at each perigee. Its purpose is to show the regular wave-like pattern of the perigees advancing and receding
        over time.
      </li>
      <li>Solid white circles show the perigees which are within 24 hours of a Super Moon.</li>
      <li>
        Black circles with white outline show the perigees which are within 24 hours of a Super <em>New</em> Moon.
      </li>
      <li>You can click on any circle. This will allow us to examine it in more detail.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-mode="long">
      We can see that the closest perigees seem to be the ones that coincide with full moons or new moons. This is
      presumably due to the gravitational effects of the three bodies being roughly aligned. When a full moon or new
      moon is close to its perigee, it is known as a Super Moon or Super New Moon, so these phenomena are particularly
      relevant to our quest.
    </p>
    <p data-mode="long">
      Perigees occur slightly more frequently than full moons because the Earth's rotation around the Sun means the Moon
      has to travel slightly more than one full orbit between each full moon. This means that perigees and full moons
      gradually slip in and out of phase with each other.
    </p>
    <p data-mode="long">
      If you imagine the Earth/Moon orbital ellipse rotating around the Sun, there's a time about once per year when the
      perigee of that ellipse is on the far side of the Earth, and another time when it's between the Sun and the Earth.
      These are the times when you get Super Moons and Super New Moons, respectively.
    </p>
    <p data-mode="long">
      You'd expect Super Moon and Super New Moon periods to repeat exactly once per year, but they actually happen less
      frequently. The reason for this is 'apsidal precession', in which the orientation of the Moon's eliptical orbit
      rotates once every 8.85 years. Because it's rotating in the same direction as the Earth rotates around the Sun, it
      takes a little over a year for the line of apsides to get back to its initial orientation relative to the Sun.
      This is all explained much better by Bartosz Ciechanowski's fantastic
      <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/moon/">guide to the Moon</a>.
    </p>
    <p data-mode="long">
      Let's narrow down our search to the closest perigees of each year, which will all correspond to Super Moons or
      Super New Moons. Select any point on this chart or the previous one to examine it further.
    </p>
    <p data-mode="tldr">
      Each point on the chart represents a perigee (the point in the Moon's orbit when it is closest to the Earth) which
      is closest to a Super Moon or Super New Moon. Select one.

    <h2 data-mode="long" data-selection="perigee">Earth's Orientation to The Moon</h2>
    <p data-mode="long" data-selection="perigee">
      Now we have a time when the Moon is relatively close to the Earth, we need to know <em>which part</em> of the
      Earth it's closest to.
    </p>
    <p data-mode="long" data-selection="perigee">
      The Earth rotates around its axis faster than the Moon rotates around the Earth. So as the Moon reaches its
      perigee, the part of the Earth closest to it will form a path East to West across the Earth's surface. We can show
      this path as a highlighted area on a globe.
    </p>
    <p data-mode="long" data-selection="perigee">
      If the world were a perfectly smooth sphere, there would be exactly one point on the surface that will be closest
      to the moon at the precise moment it reaches its perigee, and <em>that</em> would be our closest possible
      location. But the world is bumpy, and hills make a difference. How far and wide do we need to search for hills?
    </p>
    <p data-mode="long" data-selection="perigee">
      One way to look at it is: for each perigee there will be one sea-level geographic location which is closest to the
      Moon right at the instant of its perigee. I'll call this potential pinnacle of proximity the "<em
        >base position</em
      >", and its distance to the Moon (from sea level) at the instant of the perigee will be the "<em>base distance</em
      >".
    </p>
    <p data-mode="long" data-selection="perigee">
      Every other geographic position on Earth is closest to the Moon at some instant in time around the perigee (in
      general this won't be the same time as for the base position). At that instant, the location will be a certain
      amount <em>further away</em> from the Moon than the base distance. I'll call that extra distance the
      "<em>delta</em>" distance. In some cases, elevated terrain close to the base position will make the delta
      negative. This will be good news for us—the more negative the better. There will be one point on Earth which has
      the absolute lowest (most negative) delta. This will be the "<em>perfect position</em>" and our mission here is to
      find it.
    </p>
    <p data-mode="long" data-selection="perigee">
      As you move North or South from the base position, the curvature of the Earth's surface means you get further away
      from the Moon. Four degrees latitude in either direction raises our sea-level deltas over 15km. By that stage no
      mountain is big enough to make up for that loss.
    </p>
    <p data-mode="long" data-selection="perigee">
      How far to search East and West is a bit more complicated. Since the Earth is spinning, an elongated strip of its
      surface presents itself to the Moon, with different parts closest at different times. In other words the delta
      increases more gradually in the longitudinal directions, depending on how fast the Moon approaches its perigee and
      recedes, as well as the speed the Earth is spinning relative to the Moon. But we can still work out a limit of the
      area we need to consider by restricting it to points where the delta is less than, say, 10km (again, because no
      land feature protrudes more than 10km above sea level).
    </p>
    <p data-mode="long" data-selection="perigee">
      Based on those calculations, the area we need to search is highlighted below. The deepest highlight colors
      represent areas where the delta is lowest, and fading out completely in areas where the delta is more than 10km.
    </p>
    <div data-mode="long" data-selection="perigee" id="earth-view"></div>
    <p data-mode="long" data-selection="perigee">
      Also shown here are a couple of lines indicating the direction of the Moon and Sun. You can adjust the time (which
      is initially set to the perigee—when the base position is closest to the Moon). This gives an idea of how the
      closest point changes over time. The translucent flat surface is the ecliptic plane (the flat surface on which the
      Earth rotates around the Sun) and is shown to give a sense of orientation because I've anchored the "up/down"
      directions to align with the Earth's poles.
    </p>

    <h2 data-selection="perigee">Terrain</h2>
    <p data-mode="long" data-selection="perigee">
      This is all well and good, but rather than defacing Mother Earth with a giant highlighter, it would be nice to
      visualize the terrain of this area. We want to see <em>which</em> land features bring you closest to the Moon if
      you're there at just the right time. The next view helps with that.
    </p>
    <p data-mode="long" data-selection="perigee">
      Here we bring in actual elevation data for topography, but it's really showing the <em>delta</em> distances to the
      Moon, so heights are intentionally warped and inaccurate. Since it's a large area and the height differences are
      relatively small, we'll need to exaggerate the heights so that areas closest to the moon are more obviously
      prominent. Areas of the Earth not directly 'under' the Moon's path have a larger delta distance, which means they
      appear to droop downwards alarmingly. I'm not a map expert, but I think this view is what's known in cartographic
      circles as a "Dalí Equirectangular Projection":
    </p>
    <div id="proximity-map-view" data-selection="perigee"></div>
    <p data-selection="perigee">
      The red pin indicates the best guess for the perfect position. More pins can be added using the "pins" slider. As
      you pan around or select pins, the selected position (indicated by the vertical line pointing to the Moon) will
      change, updating an entry in the collated data below.
    </p>
    <p data-mode="long" data-selection="perigee">
      The pin location and height accuracy are unfortunately limited by the resolution of the height map data: one
      single elevation data point covers around 3.5km&sup2;. This means we don't have sufficient information to get a
      <em>definitive</em> answer to our question.
    </p>
    <p data-mode="long" data-selection="perigee">
      However, this view at least allows us to narrow things down to certain areas. We can also use the "pins" slider to
      add the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> (and so on) best guesses for the perfect position.
    </p>
    <p data-mode="long" data-selection="perigee">
      To aid the visual sense of relative prominence to the land features here, there's a horizontal plane which you can
      raise or lower, to see which parts of the land protrude more than others (like a sea level rise flood simulation).
      This can be useful in conjunction with the sliders for rotating and tilting the view, as well as panning and
      scrolling to zoom in on promising terrain features.
