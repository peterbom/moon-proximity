    <h1>When and where on Earth am I closest to the Moon?</h1>
    <p>It sounds like a straightforward question, but happens to be deceptively complicated to answer. Why?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The distance of the Moon at its perigee (the cloest point in its orbit) varies over time.</li>
      <li>The Earth spins, so you need to work out which <i>part</i> of the Earth is closest to the Moon.</li>
      <li>
        The Earth is not perfectly spherical; it's an ellipsoid whose radius is greater at the equator than the poles.
      </li>
      <li>The Earth is not perfectly smooth; it has hills and mountains.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For any given place on Earth, you can use the excellent
      <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/app.html">Horizons</a>
      tool from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to find the exact distance of the Moon at any time, latitude, longitude
      and altitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to answer our question here, we need to go the other way. Assuming we can predict roughly when the Moon will
      be closest to the Earth, what position do we need to be at? And at exactly what time?
    </p>
    <p>
      To get started, we need to know the times when the Moon is closest to the Earth. We'll temporarily shelve any
      questions about where on the surface of the Earth we'll need to be. Here's a chart of the Moon's distance from
      Earth over time (you can zoom in to see shorter time periods):

    <p>
      Apparently it fluctuates quite wildly, but some patterns are evident. The large swings every month reflect the
      elliptical orbit of the Moon around the Earth. But you can also see that the size of the peaks and troughs varies
      somewhat regularly over time. What's going on with that?
    </p>
    <p>
      For our purposes here, we care mainly about the troughs (upside-down peaks, not animal feeders). These represent
      the points where the Moon is closest to the Earth (each 'perigee' of the lunar orbit). Let's ignore the rest of
      the orbit and focus only on the perigees. Here they are:
    </p>
    <div class="canvas-relative-container">
      <div id="perigee-time-view" class="graphic-rect"></div>
    </div>
    <p>There are a few extra things shown here:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each circle shows the distance of the Moon at its perigee.</li>
      <li>The vertical white lines represent full moons.</li>
      <li>
        The dashed line does <i>not</i> represent the distance of the Moon, but is instead a best-fit of its distance at
        each perigee. Its purpose is to show the regular wave-like pattern of the perigees getting closer and further
        away over time.
      </li>
      <li>Solid white circles show the perigees which are closest in time to Super Moons.</li>
      <li>Black circles with white outline show the perigees which are closest in time to Super New Moons.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There is a cycle which repeats a bit less than once per year, where the perigees get closest at alternating Super
      Moons and Super New Moons. These are the points where the Sun, Earth and Moon are all roughly aligned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason it's not exactly once per year is 'apsidal precession', in which the orientation of the Moon's
      eliptical orbit rotates once every 8.85 years. Because it's rotating in the same direction as the Moon rotates
      around the Earth, it takes a little over a year for the line of apsides to get back to the same orientation
      relative to the Sun. This is all explained much better by Bartosz Ciechanowski's fantastic
      <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/moon/">guide to the Moon</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we know that the Moon is closest when it's aligned with the Earth and the Sun, we can re-order our chart of
      perigees. This time, we can plot the
      <i>angle</i> of the Moon relative to its full moon position, as observed from Earth. Full moons would be close to
      0° and new moons would be around 180°. The curve here confirms the moon is consistently closest when the perigee
      coincides with both full moons and new moons. Because the points are all clustered together in this view you'll
      probably need to zoom in to distinguish them.
